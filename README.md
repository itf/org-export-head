# org-export-head
Org mode to blog exporter. Converts each header to a different file

For more features (not necessarily better features), please check my personal blog written in org-export-head, https://github.com/itf/itf.github.io/tree/source.

It contains features such as a footer (for comments), and previous and next links for the blog posts, as well as support for making indexes based on the tags.

The most updated version will always be the one in my blog, since I don't often update this version. See it on https://github.com/itf/itf.github.io/tree/source



In order for the exported references to be reasonable, you should really change the way that they are generated to the way defined here:
