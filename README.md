# org-export-head
Org mode to blog exporter. Converts each header to a different file


The most updated version will always be the one in my blog, since I don't often update this version. See it on https://github.com/itf/itf.github.io/tree/source.

Currently the most updated version is the following shell/emacs script: https://github.com/itf/itf.github.io/blob/source/exporter.el, which can be run both from inside emacs as well as a command line tool.

It contains features such as a footer (for comments), and previous and next links for the blog posts, as well as support for making indexes based on the tags.




In order for the exported references to be reasonable, you should really change the way that they are generated to the way defined here:
