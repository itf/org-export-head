# org-export-head
Org mode to blog exporter. Converts each header to a different file

For more features (not necessarily better features), please check my personal blog written in org-export-head, https://github.com/itf/itf.github.io/tree/source.

It contains features such as a footer (for comments), and previous and next links for the blog posts

The most updated version will always be the one in my blog, since I've stopped updating this after the minimum example worked. See it on https://github.com/itf/itf.github.io/tree/source
